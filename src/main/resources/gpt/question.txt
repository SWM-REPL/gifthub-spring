But please keep this format and return it based on Korean.
However, you don't have to choose only one category from the given strings, you can combine the given strings to categorize them.
For example, given the string ["Iced Café Americano T2", "+ Mascarpone Tiramisu", "Say", "THANKS"], categorize "Iced Café Americano T2 + Mascarpone Tiramisu" as product_name.

please do not categorize gift certificates issuers by brand name or product name, such as "kakaotalk 선물하기" or "Gifti Show".
The contents of the strings in the list in the given texts json should not be changed, only the strings in the list themselves should be sorted.
And Return the expiration date in this format, where year is a 4-digit number and month and day are 2-digit numbers.
And the barcode number has 12 digits. Remove any hyphens or spaces and return it as 12 consecutive digits.

"expires_at" :
"barcode":  }
